{"name":"AachenDelta3D","tagline":"ROBOTmaker's mods to  SeeMeCNC's RostockMaxV2","body":"### Welcome to AachenDelta3D\r\nThis is a branch of the great RostockMaxv2 from SeeMeCNC.  As with the Rostock name - The name of this project  is also named after a town in Germany called Aachen (pronounce a bit like Arcken)- as we are based near there. \r\n\r\nThe branch has been set up to capture all mods carried due to specific functionality that ROBOTmaker require for their internal use. These mods  may be better or worse than the original design RostockMaxV2 but they work for us. We attempt to keep the design compatible so future mods from SeeMeCNC can easily be adopted.\r\n\r\nWe created this Branch so we can easily share any changes done with the community and capture additional ideas and comments too. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
